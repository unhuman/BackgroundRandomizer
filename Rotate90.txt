Yes, PLFilterRotate was removed because it produced extremely low-quality
(nearest-neighbor) rotates. Also, in the case of 90-degree rotates, it changed
the size of the bitmap by one pixel...

Writing a rotate-by-90-degrees function isn't hard. Here's the apply
function of a PLFilterRotate90:

void PLFilterRotate90::Apply(PLBmp * pBmpSource, PLBmp * pBmpDest) const
{
// Only works for 32 bpp.
PLASSERT (pBmpSource->GetBitsPerPixel() == 32);

int oldWidth = pBmpSource->GetWidth();
int oldHeight= pBmpSource->GetHeight();
int newWidth = oldHeight;
int newHeight = oldWidth;

// Calculate the size of the new bitmap
pBmpDest->Create (newWidth, newHeight, pBmpSource->GetBitsPerPixel(), 
pBmpSource->HasAlpha(), pBmpSource->GetResolution());

PLPixel32 pix;

pBmpSource->Lock (true, false);
pBmpDest->Lock (false, true);
for (int newY = 0; newY<newHeight; ++newY) 
{
for (int newX = 0; newX<newWidth; ++newX) 
{
int oldX = newY;
int oldY = oldHeight - newX - 1;
pix = pBmpSource->GetPixel(oldX,oldY);
pBmpDest->SetPixel(newX,newY,pix);
}
}

pBmpDest->Unlock ();
pBmpSource->Unlock();
}

Hth,
